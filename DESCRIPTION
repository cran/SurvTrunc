Description: Package performs Cox regression and survival distribution function estimation when the survival times are subject to double truncation. The estimation procedure for each method involves inverse probability weighting, where the weights correspond to the inverse of the selection probabilities and are estimated using the survival times and truncation times only. Both methods require that the survival and truncation times are quasi-independent. A test for checking this independence assumption is also included in this package. The functions available in this package for Cox regression, survival distribution function estimation, and testing independence under double truncation are based on the following methods, respectively: Rennert and Xie (2017) <doi:10.1111/biom.12809>, Shen (2010) <doi:10.1007/s10463-008-0192-2>, Martin and Betensky (2005) <doi:10.1198/016214504000001538>.
